Pycraft is an OpenGL, OpenWorld, Video Game made entirely with Python. This project is a test to shed some light on OpenGL programming in Python as it is a seldom touched area of Python's vast amount of uses. Feel free to give this project a run, and message me if you have any feedback! <br />
Made with Python 64-bit and Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

_Please note; all previous versions of Pycraft, with the exception of the most recent, have been moved to the releases section; Please consult the releases section of this README for more information_

Progress towards Pycraft v0.9.4: ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/60) <br />
Documentation Progress: ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/50) <br />
Installer Progress: ![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/70) <br />

## Update Timeline
Pycraft will be continually updated for a long time yet. The next few releases, Pycraft v0.9.x will not feature as a (.exe) release but only as a code release. Pycraft will now updated gradually, not all in one go, however (.exe) releases will likely only occur at major releases like the upcoming Pycraft v0.10! The following plan was taken from my Medium article: How We are Making a Video Game in Python #2 (here: https://medium.com/@PycraftDev/how-we-are-making-a-video-game-in-python-2-547b504bbd67) <br />

At present this looks to be the schedule for Pycraft updates: <br />
* Pycraft v0.9.4 - This update, which is being worked on now, will feature the start of a documentation worked on here: https://python-pycraft.readthedocs.io/en/pycraft-v0.9.3/ (be aware, this link will change), and here on GitHub (over at the official releases under the wiki tab). This update also features the integration of the new installer which shall guide you through the installation process.
* Pycraft v0.9.5 — Will add better lighting, as well as a sun to the game! This update will also include the introduction of day and night cycles (20 minutes from sunset to sunrise), including clouds and dynamic skyboxes (featuring stars and night and day scenes). <br />
* Pycraft v0.9.6 — This will add weather events to the sky box, as well as updated sounds, including libraries for night sounds, day sounds, rain sounds, snow sounds, ambient music, footstep sounds on wet ground, footstep sounds on snow, hurt sounds, civilisation sounds, ocean sounds, and environmental sounds (like trees and grass). <br />
* Pycraft v0.9.7 — This will add an ocean to the OpenGL environment, as well as hopefully fixed collisions and much improved frame rates in game. <br />
* Pycraft v0.9.8 — This update will add structures (like buildings, trees, grass, boats, people) to the game. <br />
* Pycraft v0.9.9 — This update will feature interactions with the objects added in the previous update. <br />
* Pycraft v0.9.10 — This update will feature the addition of a story line to the game. <br />
* Pycraft v0.9.11 — This update will feature a start position in game, as well as saving your progress and loading them on a start screen, this update will also begin the process of playthrough! <br />
* Pycraft v0.9.12 — This update will feature a GUI, as well as an in-game character! <br />
* Pycraft v0.10 — This update is set to be released in Spring of 2022 at the earliest! This will showcase all the sub-updates to Pycraft v0.9, as well as featuring a compiled version. This update will also improve upon features added in sub-updates, as well as improving performance, and lots of bug fixes. <br />
* Pycraft v0.10.1 — This update will feature the addition of inventory items. <br />
* Pycraft v0.10.2 — This update will feature improvements to the inventory and map GUIs, this is as far as the plan reaches so far! <br />
